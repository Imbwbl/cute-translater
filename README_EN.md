# Transfem Communication :3

A shitty idea I got that il basically a base 8 encoder with cuter encoding. It's not really a language, but it's a way to communicate with other transfems *(trust me)*.

## How it works

Just press the buttons and it will generate a string. You can then copy and paste it to your friends, and they can decode it. It's that simple.  
Also you can just encode bytes and decode them back and I think that every optimised protocol should have that.
